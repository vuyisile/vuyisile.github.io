### Feedback on HTML via code reviewing

Hello there!.. last week we given an assignment to create our own websites or pages and yesterday (2017-07-18) we had our first code review, which was super cool because we look through each others code, compare the code and get help or advice (which is great feedback). What i liked about it is that we get to see our mistakes and we help eachother fixing them and, you find that we want the same thing on our webs but you used the long method of getting it and someone else has the a shorter method.

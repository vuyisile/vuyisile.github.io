Hello there! just finished up with HTML, and this blog post is about what i have learned in html through freecodecamp.org.

### first i researched about the background of html (what html really is)-

-its a markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.
-consists of elements, which are mainly the building blocks of markup pages.
-it describes or reflects the intended structure and meaning of a webpage and originally included cues for the apearence of     the document.
-the web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or local storage and render to the multimedia web pages.
-HTML constructs allows you to embed images and interactive forms into the rendered page.

### then i learned styling
-which we use to create something that could be desired by users because user experience is important.
-we can style ower own webpages using css and scss for responsive web design.

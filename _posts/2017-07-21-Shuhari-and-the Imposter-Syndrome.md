### ShuHaRi vs Imposter-Syndrom

hello there! so we were given task to read up on the Sh-ha-ri and the Imposter Syndrome.

imposter syndrome can be defined as a mental-disorder or concept that is used to describe high-archieving people who are marked by an incapability to internalize their archievments and fear to be exposed as frauds. it can be presented by thoughts like "i must not fail" or "i just got lucky". Overworking, fear of failure and focus on perfection are signs of imposter experience.

ShuHaRi is a concept that describes the stages of learning how to Master something.

for example Mastaring rules:


Shu - obeying or following the rules.

Ha  - reflect on the rules, look for exceptions (break them).

Ri  - Be the rules and open doors for creative techniques.

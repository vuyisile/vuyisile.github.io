### SSH- Secure Shell


- Is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

- SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to verify the identity of the remote computer and the user on the network.

- SSH only verifies whether the same person who is offering the public key also owns the matching private key.


### Ways to use SSH:


- to use automatically generated Public-Private Key pair to encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.

- or use a manually generated Public-Private Key pair to perform verification which allows programs or users to log on without specifying passwords.

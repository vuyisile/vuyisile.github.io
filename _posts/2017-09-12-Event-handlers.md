#Event-Handler Defination
A function or method containing program statements (or software routines) that are executed in response to an event action such as keystrokes and mouse movements. With web sites, event handlers make the web dynamic.

Javascript is a common method of scripting event handlers that allow us to run bits of code when events occur.
Examples of Event Handlers:
- onLoad()
- onSubmit()
- onSelect()
- onFocus()
- onKeyPress()
- onClick()

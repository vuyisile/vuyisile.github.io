## Feedback on team methodologies

Hey there, todays blog post is about Agile software development and the only thing i understand about agile is that its a methodology that focuses on creating a dynamic team where the environment is easy to adapt to.
being agile means that you are allowed to change in motion not forgetting the aim or what is required based on the project, which is why the customer is needs to be part of the team (so that he/she sees the progress and there to remind you of what is required).
Agile is a very difficult methodology to understand so i aim to get a clear picture of what it is (including all the other methodologies).

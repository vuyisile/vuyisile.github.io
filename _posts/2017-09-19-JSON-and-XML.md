#JSON vs XML.

XML and JSON can bothe be use to recieve data from a web server, but the is a difference between the two even though they can be used to perform the same task.

-  XML is a mark-up language and JSON is a way of representing objects. 

-  XML uses attributes to structure and contain the data, while JSON uses objects and proparties to do the same.

- JSON doesn't use end tags like XML, which is part of what makes it's syntax shorter than XML. 

- JSON is easier to read and write.

- XML has to be parsed with an XML parser and JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function, meaning XML is much more     difficult to parse than JSON. JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.


- JSON supports datatype and arrays, while XML does not provide datatype and does not support array. 

- XML support for Namespaces and Comments while JSON does not support Namespaces and comments.

### Dijktra algorithm

As we know that an algorithm is an effetive method that contains sequences of actions that are expressed over a set of time in a well defined formal language for discribes the calcultion of a function,starting from  initial state and initial input. Edgar W. Dijkstra came up with his own version of algorithm. Dijktra algorithm to find the shortest path from A to B.

### Turing (Programming Language)

Is a programming language that is similar to Pascal, know as an imperative and procedural language. like Pascal it is also an efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using **structured programming** and **data structuring**.

-structuring programming aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loopsâ€”in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement, which could lead to "spaghetti code" that was difficult to follow and maintain.

#Algorithm

An Algorithm is a precise step by step plan for a computational procedure that possibly begins with an input value and yields an ouput value in a finite number of steps.

Usually algorithms consist of an Input -> Procedure (the steps needed to lead to a specific output) -> Output. Mostly used when creating functions like:
- Palindromes,
- Ceaser_Cipher cryptographic methods, and more..

My observation from last week that, while i was reading and researching on some stuff i realized that i take a long time understang the information and i discovered that the reason could be that when i study i focus on the reading and i don't give myself time to break down the information or think about what i got from what i read.

I got feedback from a team mate,saying that i should start small meaning that i should read a paragraph and break it down (pointing out what i got from the information) so that it gets easy for me to knowledge and understanding after the study.

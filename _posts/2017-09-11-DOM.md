The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. It defines a standard for accessing document, meaning that it is a platform and language neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to access and update the content.

The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree **(Main point -> Branches -> Supporting points)**. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style or content. Nodes can have **event handlers** attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.W3C engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.

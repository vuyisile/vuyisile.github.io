this week has been wonderful, we had an interesting task creating webpages. From that i learnt that every code should have a clean layout because we use similar but different resources to run them, so in order to accomodate most of the resourse we have make a general structure, example in HTML: using the **<div>** element with in the **<body>** element.  

**What to improve:**

i realized that i hardly read and/or be analytical and because of that i have been missing out on the most important things that i have to understand.i have been asking around for tips on how to get started reading well, and one of the tips from Johannes was "start reading about something that you are interested in learning and understanding". so this will be one of the things i should improve.

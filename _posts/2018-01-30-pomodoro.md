# Pomodoro

## Overview
## Instructions {user stories}

    Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.
    Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
    User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
    User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
    Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
    When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. 
    You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

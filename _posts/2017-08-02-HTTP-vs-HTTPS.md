### Comparing HTTP and HTTPS.



## Hyper Text Transfere Protocol

 
- A Protocol which data is not securely shared between the web server and web browser.so when you visit a page served over HTTP, your connection is open for eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Most websites are served over HTTP because they don't involve passing sensitive information back and forth and do not need to be secured. 

- All communication sent over regular HTTP are in **plain text** and can be read by any hacker that manages to break in the communication, which is clearly dangerous.

- An attacker can replace the HTTP content on the page you're visiting in order to steal your credentials, take over your account, acquire sensitive data about you, or attempt to install malware on your computer. 


## Hyper Text Transfere Protocol Secure

- A Protocol which data is securely shared between the web server and web browser because it is encrypted to avoid eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

- Asymmetrically encrypted (Public-Private Key pair).

- Consists of SSL and/or TLS certificates for encryption.

### Feedback on the Book "how to read a book: the ultimate guide"

Hello there!! today's blog post is a my reflection on the book or essey called "how to read a book: the ultimate guide" by Mortimer Adler.
in the book he speaks of different types of reading and my understanding is that:

1) Elementary - is reading without understanding or focusing on analysing a book.


2) Inspectional reading - examining the book's blueprint meaning that you just look at what the book has in store and weather it contains what you want to put effort in.

3) Analytical reading - this is the part where you read thoroughly and making sure that you don't miss any detail of the book, making or having a clear understanding of what every part of the author is saying.

4) Syntopical reading - where you will be reading books with the same subject and comparing the ideas, vocabulary and arguments, which meant you will be checking for relevant passages.

#What is an API?
An API is a set of subroutine definitions, system of rules and tools for building application software. In general terms, its set of defined method of communication between various software components. It may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library.

#The purpose of APIs

APIs make it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks of software, which are then combined together to build a program. An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structure, object classes, variables or remote calls.

#Examples of different forms of APIs:
- Java API
- C++ Standard Template Library
- POSIX
- Microsoft windows API

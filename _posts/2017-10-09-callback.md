### Callbacks


A callback function or higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction. A callback function is essentially a pattern (that contains a solution to a common problem), and therefore, the use of a callback function is also known as a callback pattern.

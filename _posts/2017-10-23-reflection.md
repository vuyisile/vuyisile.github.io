# Reflection. 

Failure, and how we respond to it, is where self-improvement lies. I often struggle to admit my weakness, because i fail to accept that something is beyond my capablities at that given time. 

On friday we were given tasks and while I was sovling them, I had ideas of how to do them but one thing I did not do is completely understanding what is needed, because I assumed that I knew what is wanted and I only thought of what to use. After a reflection by one of our mentors, thought about what he said I realized that I wasn't solving the problems, I was writing code for the sake of finishing (which its time consuming because I took a lot of time trying to get the result wanted) and not think them through / breaking them down. 

# What I think makes me fail to deliver.
Is that:

- I always assume that i know what need without understanding.
- I need to practice logical thinking and applying that logic when solving a problem.
- I need to practice writing code more.

In conclusion, recognition of failure is a good practice and it can really help us to do better in future and its part of self-improvement.
